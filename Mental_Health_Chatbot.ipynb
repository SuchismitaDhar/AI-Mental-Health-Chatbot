This includes: \\n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \\n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \\n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \\n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \\n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \\n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \\n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \\n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \\n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \\n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \\n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \\n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \\n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \\n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \\n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor\\u2014many now offer online or phone appointments.

However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \\n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \\n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \\n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

Thank you for meeting with me today. I'm here seeking counseling because my anxiety has been significantly impacting my life and preventing me from living it fully. In this session, I hope to understand the root causes of my anxiety and develop effective coping mechanisms.\\n\\nFor quite some time now, I've been experiencing a constant sense of unease. My thoughts are consumed by worries and worst-case scenarios, causing me significant distress. I often feel restless, unable to relax, and struggle to concentrate on tasks or enjoy activities.\\n\\nA recent event that triggered intense anxiety was when I had to attend a social gathering where I did not know many people. Just the thought of interacting with strangers made me extremely anxious. During the gathering, my heart raced, I began sweating profusely, and I felt light-headed.\\n\\nThese symptoms have been present for several months now and occur frequently throughout the week. The intensity varies, but there are days when my anxiety completely immobilizes me, preventing me from leaving the house or engaging in social interactions.\\n\\nReflecting on my past, I recall having a highly critical parent who exerted significant pressure on me to meet high standards. This environment may have contributed to my development of generalized anxiety disorder.\\n\\nCurrently, I utilize deep breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and positive self-talk as coping strategies. While they provide temporary relief, I find it challenging to apply them consistently and effectively.\\n\\nI wanted to discuss potential treatment options available for managing my anxiety. Can you explain how therapy can help in changing negative thinking patterns associated with anxiety? Additionally, are there any alternative therapies you would recommend?\",\n          \"I constantly worry about what others think of me. I replay conversations over and over in my head, analyzing every word and gesture for signs of rejection or judgment. This need for validation and the fear of being disliked has severely impacted my self-esteem. I'm hoping to build healthier self-image and find ways to stop seeking external approval.\",\n          \"Recently, I've noticed a pattern in my friendships where I tend to prioritize others' needs over my own. I always put their happiness before mine and end up neglecting my own well-being. This leaves me feeling drained and unfulfilled. How can I set boundaries and learn to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty or selfish?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15984,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Navigating challenges related to discrimination and finding acceptance among family and friends can indeed be difficult, as it takes a toll on your mental health. It's commendable that you are seeking coping strategies to help you overcome these obstacles and gain confidence in embracing your LGBTQ identity. \\n\\nOne helpful strategy is to surround yourself with individuals who are supportive and understanding of your identity. Seek out online or in-person communities where you can connect with others who share similar experiences. Engaging with these communities can provide a sense of belonging and support, which can positively impact your mental well-being.\\n\\nEducate yourself about LGBTQ history, rights, and achievements. Understanding the struggles faced by others in the community and their resilience can offer inspiration and strength. Additionally, being knowledgeable about legal protections and resources available to LGBTQ individuals can empower you when advocating for your own rights.\\n\\nSelf-care practices are vital in maintaining good mental health. Find activities that bring you joy, relaxation, or peace, whether it's reading, exercising, crafting, or spending time in nature. Making self-care a priority will replenish your energy, reduce stress, and improve your ability to cope with challenges.\\n\\nConsider seeking professional counseling or therapy. A mental health professional can provide personalized guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. They can also teach you effective coping skills, such as cognitive-behavioral techniques, mindfulness exercises, and stress management strategies. Remember, there are therapists who specialize in working with LGBTQ clients and can offer a safe space free from judgment.\\n\\nAdvocacy can be empowering and therapeutic. Explore opportunities to get involved within the LGBTQ community, whether through volunteering, supporting queer organizations, or attending events and workshops. Contributing to causes you care about can give you a sense of purpose, create a wider support network, and empower you to make a positive impact.\\n\\nFinally, remember that self-acceptance is a journey. Embracing your LGBTQ identity may take time, but know that your identity is valid and deserving of love and acceptance. Surround yourself with affirmations, positive messaging, and supportive resources to remind yourself of this truth.\\n\\nAs you navigate these challenges, believe in yourself and your ability to overcome them. Building a strong support system, practicing self-care, seeking professional guidance when needed, engaging in advocacy, and embracing self-acceptance are important steps toward finding confidence and navigating the discrimination you face. Take things at your own pace and remember that healing and growth are possible.\",\n          \"It can be challenging when anxiety starts to dominate your thoughts and actions, making it difficult to find relief. Excessive worry and fear can certainly take a toll on your daily life and make it hard to concentrate or enjoy activities. It's understandable that you're seeking guidance on how to break free from its hold.\\n\\nOne approach that may help is practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness involves bringing your attention to the present moment without judgment. By focusing on what is happening right now, rather than getting caught up in anxious thoughts about the future or past, you may find some relief. There are various techniques you can try, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or body scans.\\n\\nAnother strategy to consider is challenging your anxious thoughts. When you notice yourself engaging in excessive worry or fear, ask yourself if there is evidence to support those thoughts. Often, anxiety tends to exaggerate potential dangers or negative outcomes. By questioning the validity of these thoughts, you can start to challenge their power over you.\\n\\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to develop a decision-making process that works for you. Breaking down decisions into smaller steps and considering the pros and cons can provide a sense of structure and clarity. Sometimes, making a list of options and gathering information can also alleviate anxiety around decision-making.\\n\\nEngaging in regular physical activity can have a positive impact on anxiety levels as well. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Finding an activity that you enjoy, whether it's going for a walk, dancing, or playing a sport, can not only distract you from anxious thoughts but also promote overall well-being.\\n\\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out to trusted friends or family members for support. Talking about your feelings with someone who cares about you can provide comfort and perspective. They may even offer suggestions or insights based on their own experiences.\\n\\nRemember, breaking free from anxiety takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. If you find that your anxiety continues to significantly impact your daily life, it may be beneficial to seek professional help from a mental health expert who can provide personalized guidance and support.\",\n          \"I can see how your need for solitude and control has become a deeply ingrained part of your life. It's understandable that the disruption caused by the pandemic and your mother's insistence on your engagement in social activities has added to your stress. However, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions. By manipulating the situation, you may be inadvertently creating tension and misunderstandings between you and your mother. This could lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and even resentment.\\n\\nInstead, I would suggest adopting a more open and honest approach. Try communicating openly about your feelings and the reasons behind your preferences. Share with your mother how the pandemic has affected you and how her insistence on social activities makes you feel. By doing so, you can help her understand your perspective and work collaboratively to find solutions that respect both your needs and hers.\\n\\nMoreover, it's essential to recognize that social connections are an integral part of mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and connecting with others can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. By finding ways to balance your need for solitude with your social connections, you can create a more fulfilling and balanced life.\\n\\nIn summary, while it's essential to respect your need for privacy and control, it's equally important to consider the potential benefits of engaging in social activities and maintaining healthy relationships. By adopting an open and honest approach, you can find solutions that respect both your needs and those of your loved ones, ultimately contributing to your overall well-being.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
